### Summary
This project analyses the onset symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and explores its relationship with MS-related anxiety and depression. A longitudinal cohort was selected from the UKMSR that includes the population's demographics and symptoms. The analysis was carried out using R and RStudio, and the results were visualised to explore the disease progression of MS and the association with anxiety and depression.
